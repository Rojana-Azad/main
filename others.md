## Miscellaneous Stuff

Besides my academic interests, I am also an amateur [Tabla](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Tabla) player. I have been trained in the modes of Indian Classical Music, first under *Satish Sarker* (of Farukkhabad Gharana) at [Bulbul Lalitakala Academy](https://wikiwand.com/en/articles/Bulbul_Lalitakala_Academy) and later under *Gautam Ghosh* (of Benaras Gharana) at [Chhayanaut](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Chhayanaut). You can watch one of my performances [here](https://youtu.be/0gtQtR_AQi0?si=zWVXzjPZskD3KHB).
