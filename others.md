## Miscellaneous Stuff

Besides my academic interests, I am also an amateur [Tabla](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Tabla) player. I have been trained in the modes of Indian Classical Music, first under *Satish Sarker* (of Farukkhabad Gharana) at [Bulbul Lalitakala Academy](https://wikiwand.com/en/articles/Bulbul_Lalitakala_Academy) and later under *Gautam Ghosh* (of Benaras Gharana) at [Chhayanaut](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Chhayanaut). You can watch one of my performances [here](https://youtu.be/0gtQtR_AQi0?si=zWVXzjPZskD3KHB). 

I am an avid fan of the Pokemon franchise. 

I have a lot of interest in Learning how to Learn, i.e, mastering methods to learn things fast, and Personal Information/Knowledge Management Systems (PKMS). 

I am also interested in psychotherapeutic interventions to cultivate good mental health and healing. I have a Certification of 80 hours of training in **Basic Counselling Skills** from [Freedom Within, Bangladesh](https://freedomwithinbd.org/). 

Among my volunteer activities, I was the **Academic Coordinator** of [Bangladesh Physics Olympiad](https://www.bdpho.org/) in 2018, and an **Academic Memeber** of [Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad](https://matholympiad.org.bd/) from 2015-2017.
