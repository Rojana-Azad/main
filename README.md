## About
I am Jishnu Mahmud (he/him), a junior lecturer at BRAC University and a research assistant under Professor Shaikh Anowarul Fattah, PhD, at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). I completed my Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) undergraduate studies at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). I am seeking PhD opportunities in quantum information and computation for the following Fall (2025) session.

# Research Interest
I am vastly interested in the domain of quantum sciences, including,  but not limited to, quantum information theory, quantum machine learning, quantum state tomography, and quantum error mitigation. I did my undergraduate thesis on quantum machine learning algorithms under the supervision of Dr. Fattah. We proposed several modifications to the conventional quantum convolutional neural network structure to facilitate classical data processing.

### Current Work

  1. I am involved in a new research project with Dr. Fattah, which aims to develop various algorithms for the dimension reduction of classical data using quantum learning networks so that the reduced  versions can be processed by NISQ quantum networks in the later stages; this method would provide a smart quantum alternative to classical autoencoders and principal component analysis which are computationally much costlier and involves the training of a multitude of parameters.
     
  2. I am also working on another research project with Sowmitra Das, a visiting researcher at Imperial College London, on using shadow tomography and classical machine learning to facilitate quantum error mitigation on noisy quantum circuits. We believe that shadow tomography offers tremendous possibilities and hope to show that it can be the answer to developing state-of-the-art error mitigation techniques.
