## Welcome to Rojana Binte Azad's Website

Hello! I am Rojana Binte Azad, a passionate microbiology and molecular genetics researcher with a deep commitment to advancing agricultural and biological sciences. My journey began with a fascination for biological systems, leading me to pursue academic and research excellence in plant genetics, microbial interactions, and disease resistance.

With a solid foundation in agricultural science and biotechnology, I have spearheaded projects to improve wheat blast resistance and manage fungal pathogens. As the first woman in my family to pursue a PhD, I aim to inspire future generations to see research as achievable and transformative. In the future, I want to explore the molecular mechanisms of biological systems and contribute to innovative solutions for global challenges.

## Overview of My Research

### **Blast Resistance in Wheat**
I have dedicated significant efforts to developing wheat varieties resistant to blast disease. My master’s thesis focused on integrating the *Rmg8* resistance gene from winter wheat (genotype S-615) into the Bangladeshi spring wheat variety BARI Gom 33. Through bioassays and marker-assisted screening, I successfully developed resistant lines, making it the first deployment of *Rmg8*-integrated wheat in Bangladesh. This project was funded by the Research Management Wing (RMW) at BSMRAU, where I served as the Principal Investigator.

### **Pathogen Management and Bioactive Compounds**
As a Research Assistant in Dr. Tofazzal Islam’s team, I worked on isolating and characterizing fungal pathogens, including *Magnaporthe oryzae Triticum* (MoT) and *Bipolaris sorokiniana*. I also explored bacterial bioactive compounds as sustainable solutions for managing fungal diseases.

### **Mutation Breeding for Blast Resistance**
I contributed to a mutation breeding project, where we screened M4-generation wheat for blast resistance, identifying robust mutant populations resistant to disease.

### **Collaborations**
I have collaborated with researchers in Japan and Canada to genotype advanced wheat lines, expanding the scope and impact of my work on global agricultural challenges.
