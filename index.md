# About

## Welcome to Rojana Binte Azad's Website

Hello! I am Rojana Binte Azad, a passionate researcher in microbiology and molecular genetics with a deep commitment to advancing agricultural and biological sciences. My journey began with a fascination for biological systems, leading me to pursue academic and research excellence in plant genetics, microbial interactions, and disease resistance.

With a solid foundation in agricultural science and biotechnology, I have spearheaded projects aimed at improving wheat blast resistance and managing fungal pathogens. As the first woman in my family to pursue a PhD, I aim to inspire future generations to see research as both achievable and transformative. In the future, I hope to explore the molecular mechanisms of biological systems and contribute to innovative solutions for global challenges.
