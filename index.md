# About

This is the personal website of Sowmitra Das (Sumit). I am a Visiting Researcher in Theoretical Quantum Information Sciences at Imperial College London, and a Senior Lecturer at the School of Data and Sciences at BRAC University. I work in Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Computation, and am currently looking for PhD positions. 

My current interests lie in bridging the gap between the NISQ era and the Fault-Tolerance era of Quantum Computation. As such, my specific interests are in the fields of Quantum Error Correction, Mitigation and Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computation. I am also interested in developing high-level programming primitives for designing next-generation Quantum Algorithms. 

I teach Quantum Computing courses at BRAC University. In the past, I have worked on designing nerual netoworks for image classification tasks. 

You can find links to all of my activities on the sidebar.
